The firewall system role can reset all settings to the default
configuration found immediately after Red Hat Enterprise Linux is
installed.

We’ll reset the firewall configuration in the `+rhelvm+` host.

First, in the `+rhelvm+` terminal, list the current rules.

[source,bash]
----
firewall-cmd --list-all
----

[root@rhelvm ~]# firewall-cmd –list-all public (active) target: default
icmp-block-inversion: no interfaces: enp1s0 sources: services: cockpit
dhcpv6-client http ssh ports: 9999/tcp protocols: forward: yes
masquerade: no forward-ports: port=9999:proto=tcp:toport=12345:toaddr=
source-ports: icmp-blocks: rich rules:

....

In the `rhel` terminal, we'll create a new host file called `reset`.

```bash
tee -a /root/reset << EOF
all:
  hosts:
    rhelvm:
  vars:
    firewall:
      - previous: replaced
EOF
....

From the `+rhel+` terminal, run the playbook to reset the firewall rules
on the `+rhelvm+` host.

[source,bash]
----
ansible-playbook -i reset -b firewall.yml
----

.reset output
image::resetplaybook.png[reset output]

When the playbook as stopped running, switch to the `+rhelvm+` terminal
and check that the firewall rules have been reset.

[source,bash]
----
firewall-cmd --list-all
----

[root@rhelvm ~]# firewall-cmd –list-all public (active) target: default
icmp-block-inversion: no interfaces: enp1s0 sources: services: cockpit
dhcpv6-client ssh ports: protocols: forward: yes masquerade: no
forward-ports: source-ports: icmp-blocks: rich rules: ```

If you want to apply the rules we created in the previous steps of this
lab, simply run `+ansible-playbook -i hosts -b firewall.yml+` again.
