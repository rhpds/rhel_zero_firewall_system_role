This lab is composed of two hosts.

In this lab, we will use the host `+rhel+` as the "`control node`" or
the node where we will install and run the firewall system role.
Firewall changes will be applied to `+rhelvm+`.

We’ll perform the following 3 tasks.

[arabic]
. We will use the firewall system role to open the appropriate port to
access web servers on `+rhelvm+`. This exercise is to show how to open
firewall ports by service.
. As well, we will also use the firewall system role to open port 9999
on `+rhelvm+` to enable inbound tcp connections. This exercise is to
show how to open an arbitrary firewall port.
. Finally, we’ll configure port forwarding from 9999 to port 12345 on
`+rhelvm+`.
